Farmer Marketplace Web Platform

Full-Stack Web Project

Developed a two-role marketplace enabling Farmers to register, list produce (with unit-based pricing like kg, dozen, units), and manage inventory (add/update/remove items).

Built a Buyer module allowing users to register, browse products, add items to cart, and place orders.

Implemented a dummy payment gateway clone (Razorpay-style) supporting card-based mock transactions for checkout simulation.

Integrated a free distance API for farmers to calculate shipping distance between two cities; added backend logic to compute shipping cost using distance × rate per km.

Added links to real logistics services to help farmers proceed with actual delivery booking after calculating shipping costs.

Designed the front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and handled backend processes using PHP + MySQL.
